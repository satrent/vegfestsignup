	•	Promoting Human Health and Well-being:
HEAL’s meals are intentionally crafted using whole, nutrient-dense ingredients that support vitality, reduce inflammation, and honor the body’s natural healing processes. We prioritize accessibility to nourishing food, especially for communities often underserved by wellness spaces.
	•	Actively Promoting Our Planet’s Well-being:
Sustainability is at the core of our operations. From our use of compostable packaging to minimizing food waste through intentional batch cooking, HEAL reduces its environmental footprint with each meal we serve.
	•	Actively Promoting Animal Well-being:
Our plant-forward menu minimizes reliance on animal products, offering compassionate alternatives that avoid harm to animals. This approach also reduces demand for industrial animal agriculture, a leading cause of environmental degradation and animal suffering.
	•	Actively Promoting Plant-Based Eating:
Every dish we offer celebrates the abundance and versatility of plants. We create bold, flavorful meals that challenge the idea that plant-based food is limiting—proving instead that it is vibrant, satisfying, and healing.","None of my products contain animal products, animal by-products, or are tested on animals.","Yes, I acknowledge only vegan food can be advertised and sold or distributed at the festival.

Plant‑Forward & Creative Menus
Picnic offers rotating “vegasm” (plant‑based) dishes alongside their regular menu, making plant‑based food accessible and appealing.
While not exclusively vegan, our menu includes plenty of vegetarian and veganizable options—including mocktails like the Golden Hour—which encourage plant‑centric choices.
2. Supporting Local & Sustainable Food
Picnic regularly features Sunday dinner pop‑ups that highlight local culinary talent, including BIPOC + plant‑centric chefs and vendors.
As part of the “Taste of Linden Hills” events, we contribute pub mix and wine, often alongside offerings from Wedge Co‑op (well‑known for sustainable, vegan products).
3. Animal Welfare & Reducing Animal Impact
By promoting plant‑based menu items and veganizable dishes, Picnic provides alternatives that reduce reliance on animal‑derived ingredients—a meaningful way to support animal welfare through dietary choice.
4. Environmental & Community Engagement
Picnic is closely tied to neighborhood initiatives like the Linden Hills Neighborhood Council’s sustainability efforts, including native plantings, pesticide‑free campaigns, rain gardens, and biodiversity preservation.
Our partnership with Wedge Co‑op (which also sells eco-friendly, plant-based foods) strengthens the local sustainable food ecosystem.
5. Promoting Human Health & Well‑Being
Beyond plant‑forward options, Picnic offers wholesome mocktails (no alcohol) and dishes built around fresh produce and quality ingredients.
We aim to foster community well‑being by serving as a welcoming space for families, neighbors, and friends to gather—supporting mental and social health as much as physical nourishment.
Our management and leadership style—along with our supportive organizational structure and intentional culture-building—prioritize mental health and high employee morale, backed by benefits like food, drink, medical coverage, and more.","None of my products contain animal products, animal by-products, or are tested on animals.","Yes, I acknowledge only vegan food can be advertised and sold or distributed at the festival.
